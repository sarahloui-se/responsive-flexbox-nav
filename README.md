# responsive-flexbox-nav
A mobile-first, responsive, toggleable navigation bar using pure Javascript. Based on the "How to Build a Responsive Navigation Bar With Flexbox" tutorial from Envato Tuts+.

This will be used for my website, and is somewhere for me to document my learning, as I've had very little experience working with Javascript.

It turns out that I didn't need to add to the JS at all; my HTML was structured badly. HTML structure has been corrected, and the navigation now functions correctly with most of what I intended for the design.The next step is to modify the CSS to improve the design.
