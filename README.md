# responsive-flexbox-nav
A mobile-first, responsive, toggleable navigation bar using pure Javascript. Based on the "How to Build a Responsive Navigation Bar With Flexbox" tutorial from Envato Tuts+.

This will be used for my website, and is somewhere for me to document my learning, as I've had very little experience working with Javascript.

**Last update: 2021-01-10:**
I've managed to get this navigation functional enough with my design. The next step is to get the Javascript to toggle the box shadow on and off depending on the screen size. I also need to play with the CSS to get the design how I intended it to be.<
