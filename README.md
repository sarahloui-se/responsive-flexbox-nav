# responsive-flexbox-nav
A mobile-first, responsive, toggleable navigation bar using pure Javascript. Based on the "How to Build a Responsive Navigation Bar With Flexbox" tutorial from Envato Tuts+.

This will be used for my website, and is somewhere for me to document my learning, as I've had very little experience working with Javascript.
